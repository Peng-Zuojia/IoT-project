# Command and control server for controlling the robot

This is the repo of my group project for the IoT course at University of Oulu. 

## Deployment

**Device**: LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor

**Platform**: Mindstorms IDE

* Upload the Python file through Mindstorms IDE 
* Connects with the robot through Bluetooth

The file controls the robot to move forward, measure the color and length of the objects on its way.

In addition, the robot can be programmed to obtain more important metrics of the product and realize a more mature inventory management system.
